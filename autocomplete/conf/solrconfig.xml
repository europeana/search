       Use the following format to specify a custom IndexReaderFactory,

       Please note - Using a custom IndexReaderFactory may prevent

       removed from future releases if the problems cannot be

       The ReplicationHandler assumes a disk-resident index. Using a

        <!-- Use Filter For Sorted Query

        A possible optimization that attempts to use a filter to
        satisfy a search.  If the requested sort does not include
        score, then the filterCache will be checked for a filter
        matching the query. If found, the filter will be used as the
        source of document ids, and then the sort will be applied to
        that.

        For most situations, this will not be useful unless you
        frequently get the same search repeatedly with different sort
        options, and none of them ever use "score"

        An optimization for use with the queryResultCache.  When a search

        requests matching documents 10 through 19, and queryWindowSize is 50,
        then documents 0 through 49 will be collected and cached.  Any further

    <!-- Document Analysis Handler

       http://wiki.apache.org/solr/AnalysisRequestHandler

       An analysis handler that provides a breakdown of the analysis
       process of provided docuemnts. This handler expects a (single)
       content stream with the following format:

       <docs>
         <doc>
           <field name="id">1</field>

         <doc>...</doc>
         <doc>...</doc>
         ...
       </docs>

    Note: Each document must contain a field which serves as the
    unique key. This key is used in the returned response to associate
    an analysis breakdown to the analyzed document.

    Like the FieldAnalysisRequestHandler, this handler also supports
    query analysis by sending either an "analysis.query" or "q"
    request parameter that holds the query text to be analyzed. It
    also supports the "analysis.showmatch" parameter which when set to
    true, all field tokens that match the query tokens will be marked
    as a "match".

       If you register a searchComponent to one of the standard names, 
       that will be used instead of the default.

       To insert components before or after the 'standard' components, use:
    
       <arr name="first-components">
         <str>myFirstComponentName</str>
       </arr>
    
       <arr name="last-components">
         <str>myLastComponentName</str>
       </arr>

       NOTE: The component registered with the name "debug" will
       always be executed after the "last-components" 
       
     -->
